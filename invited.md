**Raluca Lefticaru** graduated from the University of Pitesti, Romania, and completed her PhD thesis in 2011 under the supervision of Prof. Florentin Ipate. She has been a Lecturer at the University of Bucharest and has held several research positions in the UK. She is currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Bradford and a Visiting Researcher at the University of Sheffield, affiliated with the Testing group. Her research interests include model-based testing, formal methods, P systems simulation, verification and testing. She has published numerous articles in prestigious journals and conferences. She has participated in various research projects and has been in the PC of over 25 conferences on Software Testing, Formal Methods and Membrane Computing.

### Sergiu Ivanov

**Sergiu Ivanov** is assistant professor (maître de conférences) of computer science at the IBISC laboratory at the Paris-Saclay University. He is currently member of team COSMO, who study the fundamental properties of complex systems, and particularly biological systems.

Sergiu Ivanov defended his PhD thesis focused on the computational power of biologically-inspired models of computing at Université Paris-Est in 2015. His principal research interest lies in applying formal models to gain insight into medical and biological problems. He focuses on a wide spectrum of discrete formal models—P systems, Petri nets, string and array rewriting, networks of Boolean automata, reaction systems, tile assembly models—and applies them to controllability of biological networks and therapy inference, as well as to understanding the underpinnings of evolution and natural selection.

Sergiu Ivanov's main research domains are:

- network medicine,
- theoretical biology,
- complex systems,
- bio-inspired models of computing.
