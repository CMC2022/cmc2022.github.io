## Conference Info

__The late submission deadline for CMC 2022 has been further extended, to July 29, 2022. Check the [relevant dates](/dates.html) and the [submission process](/submission.html).__

This year the Conference on Membrane Computing (CMC) and the Asian Conference on Membrane Computing (ACMC) are organized as a partially joint event in Trieste, Italy and Quezon City, Philippines under the umbrella event of ICMC 2022.

Membrane Computing is an area of computer science aiming to abstract computing ideas and models from the structure and the functioning of living cells, as well as from the way the cells are organized in tissues or higher order structures. It deals with membrane systems, also called P systems, which are distributed and parallel algebraic models processing multisets of objects in a localised manner (evolution rules and evolving objects are encapsulated into compartments delimited by membranes), with an essential role played by the communication among compartments and with the environment.

CMC 2022, the 23rd Internationa Conference on Membrane Computing,  aims at continuing the fruitful tradition of previous editions enriched by some new ideas and inspirations emphasising multidisciplinarity and innovative capacity. The conference is intended to bring together researchers working in Membrane Computing and related areas in a friendly atmosphere enhancing communication and cooperation.

CMC 2022 will be held in [Trieste](/venue.html) both __in person__ and __online__!
