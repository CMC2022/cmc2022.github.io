## Conference Info


Membrane Computing is an area of computer science aiming to abstract computing ideas and models from the structure and the functioning of living cells, as well as from the way the cells are organized in tis- sues or higher order structures. It deals with mem- brane systems, also called P systems, which are distributed and parallel algebraic models processing multisets of objects in a localised manner (evolution rules and evolving objects are encapsulated into com- partments delimited by membranes), with an essential role played by the communication among com- partments and with the environment.

CMC 2022, the 23rd Internationa Conference on Membrane Computing,  aims at continuing the fruitful tradition of previous editions enriched by some new ideas and inspirations emphasising multidisciplinarity and innovative capacity. The conference is intended to bring together researchers working in Membrane Computing and related areas in a friendly atmosphere enhancing communication and cooperation.

CMC 2022 will be held in [Trieste](/venue/).
