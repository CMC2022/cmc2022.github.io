## Paper Submission

### Paper format

Original research contributions (including significant work-in-progress) on membrane computing, its applications and related subjects are sought. Contributions reporting in-vivo or in-silico experimental results are particularly encouraged. Authors are invited to submit their contribution as PDF, written in English and preferrably prepared in LaTeX using [Springer LNCS style (llncs)](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

There are two tracks for submission:

**Full paper of a reasonable length**  
There is no strict page limit for submission of a full paper. Along with the review process, a maximum number of pages for the pre-proceedings or proceedings version can be defined if necessary. Additional supplementary material might be made available on a web page whose reference is mentioned within the paper.

**Extended abstract for short presentation**  
For a maximum four pages. Typical extended abstracts present significant work-in-progress, late-breaking results, or contributions from students new in the field or at the start of their research career.

Only electronic submissions are accepted. Simultaneous submission to other conferences or workshops with published proceedings is not allowed.

### Early and Late Submission

To allow greater flexibility in the submission process, CMC 2022 is giving authors two paths:

- __Early Submission__ (closed). By submitting a paper by July 1, 2022 you will receive a notification by July 22, 2022, giving more than one month to prepare the final version of the paper.  
  To perform an early submission simply upload the pdf of the manuscript by July 1, 2022.

- __Late Submission__ (extended). If you need more time to work on the paper, you can submit your paper by July 29, 2022. In this case the notification will be delayed to August 16, 2022.

### Submission via Easychair

A paper can be submitted to either CMC 2022 or ACMC 2022

For submission to ACMC 2022 please visit [the ACMC 2022 website](https://sites.google.com/dcs.upd.edu.ph/acmc2022/paper-submission).

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three referees. To ensure inclusion of an accepted contribution into the (pre)proceedings volume, at least one of its authors must be registered to CMC 2022 or ACMC 2022. The pre-proceedings volume will be available during the conference.
